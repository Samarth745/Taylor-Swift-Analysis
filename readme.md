A Data-Driven Exploration of Taylor's Discography

This project is a deep dive into Taylor Swift's music, We're gonna use the power of data to uncover the hidden secrets within her discography.

First we start with ETL to finally create 3 data sets that we require for our Analysis
## The Gathering 
### DATA 1: Feature Frenzy: The Invisible String ️‍♀️

We're bringing in Spotify's API like a decoder ring for Taylor's music.  This lets us create data points that describe a song's sonic personality,  like:

* `Danceability:` How likely are you to **shake it off** to this song? <br>
* `Valence:` Happy and carefree like **22** or a touch melancholic like **Teardrops on My Guitar**? <br>

### DATA 2: Blank Space: (Fill it with Repeated Rhymes)

Ever wondered which words Taylor loves to use together? Or how her rhyming style has evolved throughout her career?  <br>This is where we dissect her rhymes line by line and see if they're **never ever getting back together**.

### DATA 3: Call It What You Want (Love Story, Breakup Song, You Decide!)

We've compiled a list of words that scream "love song" and another list that embodies all things "breakup."<br> Then, we'll use sentiment analysis tools to understand the overall emotional tone of the lyrics.<br> Sad words = breakup anthem, happy words = love song celebration!

Based on this analysis, we'll classify each song into three categories:

* Love Songs
* Breakup Songs
* The ever-intriguing "Unknown" Category
